# Takkar Problem

## Problem Description

The Takkar problem involves determining the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum score in a given game scenario. The player must navigate through various challenges to accumulate points while adhering to specific rules.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer \( N \), the number of challenges.
- The following \( N \) lines each contain the details of the challenges, including points, difficulty, and any constraints.

## Output Format

- Output a single integer, the maximum score that can be achieved.

## Example

### Input
```
3
10 1
20 2
15 1
```

### Output
```
30
```

## Solution Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Utilize a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum score achievable at each challenge.
2. **State Representation**: Define a state that represents the maximum score at a given challenge level.
3. **Transition**: Update the score based on the choices made at each challenge.

By carefully analyzing the constraints and possible outcomes, we can derive an optimal solution that maximizes the score.
