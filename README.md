# problem-sets

My answers to the problem sets for Aizu, AdventofCode, CodeChef, Codeforces, Codegolf, CSES, Deep-ML, DMOJ, EOlymp, HackerRank, Kattis, KiloNova, Leetcode, LibreOJ, Perl Weekly Review, Project Euler, SPOJ and Timus judges — and more. These solutions are not the most practical or efficient; I have written each submission and their runtime & memory usage within the respective content judge. This is a learning experience of mine, see below what judges are present in the repostiory. also please see issues for making a scraper! :)

## Coverage at a glance

- **This repository covers problem sets from 25 websites/judges.**
- **Total problems:** 65720 + more...TBD
- **Solved:** 227
- **Progress:** ((228 − 1) / 65720) × 100 ≈ 0.3454047474

## Community notes

**[Discord Server (WIP)](https://discord.gg/sv7ku23K7y)** I will be coordinating weekly contests, share editorials, compare runtimes/memory, and track personal progress, this will be for enjoying together, furthermore I want to make a /videos/ repository where I upload videos on youtube + more.. about problems and solving them.
- **channels (TBD)**
  - `#announcements` — contest schedule, links, and judge picks for the week.
  - `#check-in` — who is participating this week; start/finish pings.
  - `#help` — hints only (no full spoilers during live windows).
  - `#systems` — tooling, IDE setups, scripts (e.g., `prog.sh`) and benchmarks.
- **Weekly cadence:**
  - Post schedule every Sunday; run at least one multi-judge set midweek and one weekend set. (when my uni gets bit less workload)
  - Rotate judges so coverage stays broad if thats what people want (Codeforces/CSES/LeetCode/Timus/Project Euler/etc.).
- **Participation workflow (TBD):**
  1) Check `#announcements` for the week’s picks.  
  2) During the window, work locally; note runtimes/memory on judge submissions.  
  3) After lock, share solutions + short commentary in `#solutions`; add editorials in `#editorials`.  
  4) Log issues/blocks in `#help`; capture tooling notes in `#systems`.
- **Bot**
    I am very inclined and open to recieving recommendations as to how to make a bot to be able to read submissions and have them, we also have a channel for advent of code golfing using the [aoc golf bot](https://github.com/Starwort/advent-of-code-golf-2025)

## Git Formatting

- When adding a solution file, use platform aliases in commit messages:
    - `cf` for Codeforces
    - `cses` for CSES
    - `pe` for Project Euler
    - `lc` for LeetCode
    - `timus` for Timus
    - `dml` for Deep-ML
    - `pwr` for Perl Weekly Review
    - `spoj` for Sphere Online Judge
    - `cc` for codechef
    - `kat` for kattis
    - `az` for aizu
    - `hr` for hackerrank
    - `hdu` for hdu
    - `kn` for kilonova
    - `loj` for libreoj

- **Commit Message Example:**
    - Adding a new Codeforces solution:  
      `cf: solution for problem 123A`

- If you add a new file unrelated to problem solutions (e.g., scripts, configs), use the `chore` or `init` prefix:  
    - `chore: add prog.sh for summary automation`
    - `init: setup initial project structure`
