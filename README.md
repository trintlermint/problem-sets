# problem-sets

This repository contains my answers to problem sets from a wide range of judges, including **Aizu**, **Advent of Code**, **CodeChef**, **Codeforces**, **Codegolf**, **CSES**, **Deep-ML**, **DMOJ**, **EOlymp**, **HackerRank**, **Kattis**, **KiloNova**, **Leetcode**, **LibreOJ**, **Perl Weekly Review**, **Project Euler**, **SPOJ**, **Timus**, and more.

> **Note:** These solutions are intended as a learning experience rather than optimal references. Most were written directly to the relevant online judges.

See below for the current coverage and progress, and refer to [issues](https://github.com/trintlermint/problem-sets/issues) for open tasks (like building a scraper).

## Community Notes

**[Join our Discord server (Work in Progress)](https://discord.gg/sv7ku23K7y):**  
Weekly contests, editorials, code/runtime comparisons, and personal progress tracking. Plans include a `/videos/` section for walkthroughs and more.

**Discord Channels (planned):**
- `#announcements` — Contest schedules, links, and judge picks.
- `#help` — Hints (no spoilers during contests).
- `#systems` — Tooling, IDE setup, scripts (e.g., `prog.sh`), and benchmarks.
- + `more. . .` - :)

**Weekly Contest Schedule:**
- New schedule every Sunday.
- At least one multi-judge set midweek and one on weekends.
- Rotating judge sources for diverse coverage. (Subject to university workload.)

**Participation Workflow (planned):**
1. Check `#announcements` for the week's picks.
2. Work locally during competition windows.
3. After lock, share solutions and editorials.
4. Discuss blocks in `#help` and note tooling in `#systems`.

**Bot Development:**  
Open to recommendations for a submissions bot! See [aoc golf bot](https://github.com/Starwort/advent-of-code-golf-2025) for inspiration. Suggest ideas in Discord.

## Aim & Current Stats

**As of 2025-10-14**

| Platform         | Solutions   |
|------------------|------------|
| Codeforces       | 11,352      |
| CSES             | 362         |

## Solution Status

```mermaid
pie showData
    "Solved" : 223
    "Unsolved" : 65497
```

## Solution Languages used

```mermaid
pie showData
    "C++" : 97
    "Shell" : 5
    "Python" : 11
    "Haskell" : 4
    "Kotlin" : 1
    "Perl" : 1
```

## Git Formatting

- When adding a solution file, use platform aliases in commit messages:
    - `cf` for Codeforces
    - `cses` for CSES
    - ... as specified in below websites

- **Commit Message Example:**
    - Adding a new Codeforces solution:  
      `cf: solution for problem 123A`

- If you add a new file unrelated to problem solutions (e.g., scripts, configs), use the `chore` or `init` or others as general conventions as prefixes:  
    - `chore: add prog.sh for summary automation`
    - `init: setup initial project structure`
    - `refactor: change the repository without changing program code`
